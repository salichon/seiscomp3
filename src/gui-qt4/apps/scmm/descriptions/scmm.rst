**scmm** is the messaging monitor, the graphical interface to :ref:`scm`. It allows to
view the messages from all modules sent around by the SeisComP3 messaging system.
Therefore, **scmm** can be used to debug configured message groups and module
connections, e.g. in a system with several processing pipelines and specific
message groups.

In addition, **scmm** allows to view the content of single messges
as well as the memory consumption and other statistics of all modules connected
to the SeisComP3 messaging system.
